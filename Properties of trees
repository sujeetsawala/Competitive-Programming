Diameter: 
1).Root the tree and find node at maximum distance.
2).Now apply a dfs from the found node and find the node at maximum distance.

This gives the diameter.

Radius:
  Radius=Daimeter/2;

Center:
1).Find the diameter of the tree.
2).Take any of the end point and apply binary lifting till the distance between the end point and the selected node is less than radius of the tree.
